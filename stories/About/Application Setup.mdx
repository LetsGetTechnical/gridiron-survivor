## Getting Started

```
  git clone --single-branch --branch develop
  https://github.com/LetsGetTechnical/gridiron-survivor.git
```

Install the required packages with pnpm (NOT npm or yarn!)

```
pnpm install
```

Create a new branch for whatever youâ€™re working on in the format firstname/feature-description, then check out your new branch. For example:

```
  git branch richard/user-picks-page && git checkout richard/user-picks-page
```

Code your feature! ðŸ¤“

## Pushing local branch to remote branch

For the first push from local to remote, use

```
--set-upstream origin
```

along with the name of your local branch, like so:

```
git push --set-upstream origin richard/user-picks-page
```

Subsequent pushes will now go to your remote upstream branch.
