## Commands to start the project

All the commands you need to start and stop the project are here in this section.

```
docker compose up app-dev
```

Stop the project and remove the container created:

```
docker compose down app-dev
```

`Note: After running docker compose down the image you pulled will still exist on your local computer`

`Note: For production, you just replace app-dev with app-prod`
