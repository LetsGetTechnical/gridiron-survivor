    # A. What is Accessibility?

    In the context of web development, accessibility means that websites and apps are designed and built such
    that everyone, including people with disabilities, can navigate them and interact with them. The goal of
    accessibility is for everyone to be able to use the web based on the abilities they have, and not to be
    excluded due to their disabilities.

    # B. Assistive Technologies

    We expect a user with disabilities to rely on special equipment and software to interact with the web (these
    are called assistive technologies), but that is not always the case. A person with low vision might just need a
    good contrast between the text and background colors to be able to see everything on the screen. Some
    users just need a dark mode setting. A person with good sight but limited hand mobility might just need to
    use the keyboard instead of the mouse.
    In most cases, assistive technologies are used by people with more serious impairments.
    A person who is blind relies on a screen reader, a technology that shares the content on the screen. It can
    do it two ways:

    - via a speech synthesizer for the user that has good hearing (the user navigates through the UI elements
    with the keyboard, and the content on the screen is shared with them through synthetic speech)
    - via a braille display, for users who are deaf or hard of hearing (The screen reader translates the contenton the screen into a format that can be read on a braille display. These displays are fitted with braille cells
    that change dynamically)

    A person with good sight but limited or no hand mobility could use speech recognition software or an
    eye-tracking system (a device that allows mouse control through eye movements).

    ## Important to keep in mind as we are building

    The mere presence of an assistive technology to aid a user in interacting with the web is not enough. Our
    application has to be programmed in a way that takes into account the needs of each group of users, and
    not just those of the typical user with good sight and good hand mobility. Sometimes, we also have to take
    into account that assistive technologies are not perfect, and given several choices to program a certain
    element, use the one that eliminates most barriers or provides a more seamless user experience.

    # C. How Accessibility Works

    As part of the rendering process, the browser builds the accessibility tree, a simplified version of the DOM
    tree. The accessibility tree contains only elements that need to be exposed to assistive technologies, like
    links or headings. Any div element with a purely decorative or container role will be ignored.
    When triggered, assistive technologies use the browser's accessibility APIs to retrieve information from the
    accessibility tree and present it to users.

    ## DOM Tree vs Accessibility Tree

    While the DOM tree is structured by HTML tags/elements, the accessibility tree is structured by roles. For
    each object in the accessibility tree, its role matches the function of its corresponding HTML element.

    ```
    // DOM tree
    <nav>
        <ul>

            <li>
                <a>Home</a>&
            </li>

            // other list items

        </ul>

    </nav>
    ```

    ```
    // Accessibility tree
    navigation
        list


            listitem
                link "Home" focusable: true focused: true
                    StaticText "Home"

            // other list items

    ```


    For each object in the Accessible Tree, the browser shares the following:

    - name (if there is one!)
    - role
    - properties (like focusable)
    - state (like focused, checked, collapsed, expanded, etc)
    Each assistive technology will use the information from the accessibility tree to present the object to the
    user in the most appropriate way:
    - a screen reader will announce it as "Home link".
    - speech recognition software will recognize it as "Home" and allow the user to activate it with the command "click Home".
