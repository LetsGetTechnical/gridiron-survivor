# DB/Auth: Supabase

## Problem:

We need a solution for storing our user’s data and handling authentication.

## Solution Requirements:

- Database should support the shape of our data
- Auth should support SSO/OAuth

## Assumptions:

- Our application’s data is spreadsheet-shaped already- we are, after all, converting a
  spreadsheet-based process into an application.

## Solution:

We’ve decided on utilizing Supabase to manage both our DB and Auth.
Supabase’s DB features are built around PostgreSQL, an open-source, powerful
object-relational database, which is the perfect fit for the type of data we’ll be handling in this
application. The interface for viewing and managing the database is top-notch, as well.
Supabase’s Auth features offer a wide range of SSO and OAuth options, and the
implementation is exceedingly simple. There is no indeed for us to manually manage auth and
juggle tokens from route to route- Supabase handles it all, and supports unlimited API requests.

## Security Considerations:

- Supabase’s security features are robust. <a target = "_blank" href = "https://supabase.com/security">Read all about them here</a>.

## Cost Analysis:

- The free version provides 500MB DB storage, 1GB file storage, 5GB bandwidth, and up
  to 50k active users- more than enough to support the application in its early stages.
- If/when we need to scale up, $25/month offers a significant upgrade to everything above,
  along with 7 days of daily DB backups, logging, and personal email support.

## Operation Readiness:

- Supabase is notoriously easy to set up.
- If we encounter issues using Supabase, the robust documentation and a quickly growing
  community around the product will ensure solutions are never far.

## Risks:

- When docs fail to illuminate a problem, we often fall back on the community around the
  tech. Since Supabase is a newer platform, the surrounding community is not as large as,
  say Firebase. However, the community is rapidly growing.

## Solutions Considered and Discarded:

- Firebase uses a NoSQL database, which is not appropriate to the shape of our data.

## Work Required:

- (L) Need to set up tables for user and commissioner data, along with appropriate queries
- (L) Need to set up a table to store sports data queried from API to serve to users
- (S) Need to set up the OAuth
