# Appwrite

# By Jason Torres

## What IS Appwrite

Appwrite was launched roughly 5 years ago by Eldad Fux and is an
open-source Backend as a Service for developers. It provides pre-built
features like Auth, database management, and real-time functionality. It
will drastically reduce the amount of server-side code we need to
write. It's going to allow us to focus more resources on the front where
the user really will be.

## Why and how we are implementing Appwrite

Appwrite continues to add features in their updates, making their
BaaS is one of the leaders in the market. There are several features that
we can lean heavily on and I have summarized a few that I think will
make GIS a great experience for the end user.

## Auth signin/signup

GIS will have multiple users with varying levels of access. With
Appwrite we can configure and manage permissions relatively
easy in the console. There is a robust set of options when it comes to
OAuth, if we add that later. For now, we are utilizing basic “email /
password.”

Giving us Auth in a simple tab in the console, which includes our
database and storage also optimizes our use of products. with the use of
the SDK, we can quickly implement the auth to whatever level
we need. They even go as far as having code samples we can use as
a base to get started.

# Sign up

You can use the Appwrite Client SDKs to create an account using email and password.

```
import { Client, Account, ID } from "appwrite";

const client = new Client()
    .setEndpoint('https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1') // Your API Endpoint
    .setProject('<PROJECT_ID>');               // Your project ID

const account = new Account(client);

const promise = account.create('[USER_ID]', 'email@example.com', '');

promise.then(function (response) {
    console.log(response); // Success
}, function (error) {
    console.log(error); // Failure
});

```

## Messaging

GIS has multiple opportunities to use this new feature from Appwrite.
As it's not yet available on the cloud we can still set up the email or
message client so when it's available we are ready. This is part of the
1.5 release. GIS users can be notified upon signup (a welcome
message with perhaps a little tutorial) using email. Each week perhaps
an SMS (if the user opts) of weekly results, or that could also be an email.
With data changing each week, I think that the ability to notify users of
the changes (win, lose, set picks, etc) is imperative and will increase
the use of the app. Thus making it an overall better experience for the
user.

## Databases storage of users and user data, login info, etc

With Appwrite, we have several options for how to use the database
and storage features. The option of server-side storage is available
using the server SDK. I am not sure of the full extent of the data we will
be keeping so it's hard to speak to this specifically. I know for the
storage (which is separate from the database) we will more than likely
be storing team images, weekly graphics, etc. a few notes about the
structure. Appwrite uses collections as containers of documents. Each
collection contains many documents identical in structure. The terms
collections and documents are used because the Appwrite JSON
REST API resembles the API of a traditional NoSQL database.
That said, Appwrite is designed to support both SQL and NoSQL
database adapters like MariaDB, MySQL, or MongoDB in future versions.

```
const sdk = require('node-appwrite');

// Init SDK
const client = new sdk.Client();

const databases = new sdk.Databases(client);

client
    .setEndpoint('https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1') // Your API Endpoint
    .setProject('5df5acd0d48c2') // Your project ID
    .setKey('919c2d18fb5d4...a2ae413da83346ad2') // Your secret API key
;

const promise = databases.create('<DATABASE_ID>', '[NAME]');

promise.then(function (response) {
    console.log(response);
}, function (error) {
    console.log(error);
});

```

## Realtime will give us the ability to see user changes as they happen.

Realtime is one of the most important features of the build. Through
the use of the subscribe method, we can listen to events and
receive data anytime it changes. For an app that does rely heavily on
user interaction, being able to show users their picks at the click of a
button seems imperative to the overall user experience. Via a
WebSocket connection, we bring this data to them within milliseconds.
Scores as they update, any user interaction being updated on the fly
will certainly increase retention. It's worth noting that there is not
currently a real-time option for server-side SDKs.

```
import { Client } from "appwrite";

const client = new Client()
  .setEndpoint('https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1')
  .setProject('<PROJECT_ID>');

// Subscribe to files channel
client.subscribe('files', response => {
  if(response.events.includes('buckets.*files.*.create')){
    // Log when a new file is uploaded
    console.log(response.payload);
  }
});

```

Appwrite has a significantly lower learning curve in comparison to
Express.js due to its pre-built API’s and features. Express would
require a deeper understanding of Node.js and backend concepts.
For someone starting, it's a very turnkey solution that gives us full
function with small code. Here are some other comparisons.
Appwrite provides SDKs and APIs for interacting with its services. It
takes away a lot of the complexity of managing the codebase for data
fetching. Whereas Express.js requires you to write custom routes and
middleware for the same task. More details, but more control over the
process Appwrite has built-in DB services (NoSQL) it also provides DB
management with SDKs and APIs for CRUD.

Storing Cookies is done with SDKs and APIs. Whereas in Express I
believe we need a cookie-parser.
JSON web tokens (JWT) are handled in Appwrite with the built-in JWT
authentication. It handles generation, verification, and management.
Express.js you have to implement JWT manually or again use
middleware.

So in summary, for our group, I strongly recommend we use the
Appwrite services as more of a turnkey solution for GIS.
