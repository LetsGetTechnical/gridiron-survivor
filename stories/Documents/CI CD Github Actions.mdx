# CI CD: GitHub Actions

# By Adam Morsa and Chris Nowicki

## Problem:

We need a solution to handle the CI/CD process of automating testing, building, and deploying.

## Solution Requirements:

- Should support custom workflows
- Ideal solution would be adjacent to our repo (GitHub)

## Assumptions:

- We are using GitHub as our repo

## Solution:

GitHub Actions is an ideal solution to handle our CI/CD process. It works seamlessly with our
repo, aligning with our philosophy that solutions across the app should be as centralized as
possible. It is also simple to create custom workflows, allowing us to set up our CI/CD pipeline to
our exact needs.

GitHub Actions is a robust CI/CD tool that will enable us to quickly iterate on our code, while
automatically catching errors before they go live.

## Security Considerations:

- Keeping our CI/CD solution in the same ecosystem as our repo ensures the fewest
  number of hands handling our application’s data.

## Cost Analysis:

- GitHub Actions is completely free of charge for public repositories.
- For private repositories, GitHub Actions is limited to 500MB of storage and 2,000
  minutes/month on the Free plan.
  Operational Readiness:
- GitHub Actions is already a part of GitHub, where our repo is hosted. It is immediately
  ready for us to begin writing workflows.
- If we have any problems using GitHub Actions, the documentation, and community
  around the tool are robust. Solutions should never be far.

## Risks:

- We should be cautious of using third-party Actions from the marketplace, as they may
  contain malicious code.
- We must never store any plaintext secrets in our actions.
- Credentials should be scoped to the minimum required permissions to execute the job.

## Solutions Considered and Discarded:

- While other solutions for CI/CD exist, it makes the most sense for us to keep it tightly
  coupled to our repo with GitHub Actions.

## Work Required:

- (XL) As the application begins getting built, the DevOps team will need to build Actions
  and Workflows to automate our testing, building, and deploying.

## Github Release Tag:

The app is currently in pre-release.
We need to first identify what PRs are going into the build.
Once the development branch is ready to go for the release, we must do the following:

1. We pause any merge into the develop
2. Once that’s done, under the Github repository releases section, select Create a new Release option
3. Click Choose a tag button, and create a tag named v.#.#.#-alpha in the tag. This should only be done when pushing to production
4. Target should be on the main branch
5. Name the release title as the application version (v.#.#.#)
6. Click the generate release notes button, and it will automatically generate all the commits and issues cataloged along with the code
7. Create PR called release version x.x.x merged from develop to main - requires 2 reviewers and someone to merge the code

We’re using semantic versioning (meaning provided via ChatGPT):

> "Symantec versioning" in the context of software development might be a typo or confusion with "Semantic versioning," which is a common practice. Semantic versioning, often abbreviated as SemVer, is a version numbering system used to signify the types of changes made between releases of a software product.
> Semantic versioning is structured as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, where:

1. MAJOR version changes indicate incompatible API changes,
2. MINOR version changes add functionality in a backward-compatible manner, and
3. PATCH version changes are made to correct backward-compatible bugs.

This system helps developers and users understand the impact of a new version of software beyond just the change in number, indicating whether new changes are likely to break existing functionality or interfaces.

GitHub releases also have automatic pipelines and more that it can do, but for right now this is the approach we want to take.
