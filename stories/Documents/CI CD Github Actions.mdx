# CI CD: GitHub Actions

Problem:
We need a solution to handle the CI/CD process of automating testing, building, and deploying.

Solution Requirements:
Should support custom workflows
Ideal solution would be adjacent to our repo (GitHub)
Assumptions:
We are using GitHub as our repo
Solution:
GitHub Actions is an ideal solution to handle our CI/CD process. It works seamlessly with our repo, aligning with our the philosophy that solutions across the app should be as centralized as possible. It is also simple to create custom workflows, allowing us to set up our CI/CD pipeline to our exact needs.

GitHub Actions is a robust CI/CD tool which will enable us to quickly iterate on our code, while automatically catching errors before they go live.

Security Considerations:
Keeping our CI/CD solution in the same ecosystem as our repo ensures the fewest number of hands handling our application’s data.
Cost Analysis:
GitHub Actions is completely free of charge for public repositories.
For private repositories, GitHub Actions is limited to 500MB of storage and 2,000 minutes/month on the Free plan. Operational Readiness:
GitHub Actions is already a part of GitHub, where our repo is hosted. It is immediately ready for us to begin writing workflows.
If we have any problems using GitHub Actions, the documentation and community around the tool is robust. Solutions should never be far.
Risks:
We should be cautious of using third-party Actions from the marketplace, as they may contain malicious code.
We must never to store any plaintext secrets in our actions.
Credentials should be scoped to the minimum required permissions to execute the job.
Solutions Considered and Discarded:
While other solutions for CI/CD exist, it makes the most sense for us to keep it tightly coupled to our repo with GitHub Actions.
Work Required:
(XL) As the application begins getting built, the DevOps team will need to build Actions and Workflows to automate our testing, building, and deploying.
