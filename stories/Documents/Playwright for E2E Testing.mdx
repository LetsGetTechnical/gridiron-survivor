Playwright for E2E Testing
Author: Jennifer Tieu
Playwright is a testing framework built by Microsoft that allows cross-browser, multi-language,
and cross-platform support using a single API. It included multiple benefits like no flaky tests
(reliability), fast execution, isolated testing, accessibility testing, headless/no headless, and
integration with CI/CD. It also seems to have good community support and documentation.
The single API with cross-browser support will allow the team to save time and reduce
complexity because we’ll be able to use the same code to test against different browsers.
It supports JavaScript and TypeScript which we’ll be using within Next.js.
Playwright is designed for end-to-end testing and that will allow the team to test the application
flow from beginning to end.
E2E: We will implement end to end testing to confirm that the application works as intended in
user’s environment and the planned user experience is correct. End to end testing can take
longer to run and maintain because it is composed of many parts so identifying key user flows to
test will be necessary to make it easier for the team to save time and reduce complexity. A
possible e2e test would be to the user navigates to the app, logins, view the teams they havent
picked yet, pick a team before the deadline, and submit.
While it may take time to set up the tests, it is beneficial in the long run. It will save the team
time from application issues as they will be addressed in the testing phase and also reduce
possible user frustration. If we consider that there will be multiple team members contributing to
the application, having tests set up will allow our team to better understand the functionality of
some features by looking at the tests.
