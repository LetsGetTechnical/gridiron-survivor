Playwright

By Mai Vang

Test pyramid is a software development framework that helps foster high-quality code by minimizing the time required for developers to determine if changes affect the existing code.

Three types:  
Unit testing - test individual blocks (class, functions)
Integration testing - testing combination of units and ensuring they work together
End to End testing - testing the entire application flow from start to finish (ex: UI to database)

Testing code is important to validate the functions are doing what we intended them to do

End-to-end testing checks a large chunk of the code. The best approach for end-to-end testing is to think like an end user. Testers consider how users may interact with the app, their aims, and potential issues to create test cases based on these actions.

The technical definition of end to end testing is – a type of testing to ensure that behavioural flow of an application works as expected by performing a complete, thorough testing, from the beginning to end of the product-user interaction in order to realize any dependency or flaw in the workflow of the application.

What is Playwright?
A free and open source framework used for E2E testing library and automation created and maintained by Microsoft. It has:
An API that allow developers and testers to write test scripts to automate web applications across different browsers, such as Chromium (Chrome), Firefox (Mozilla), and WebKit (Safari)

Headless (no gui) - everything will be running at the backend and it will save time and memory.; with head = see the physical browsers on your screen.

Web applications can be tested with Playwright on a variety of browsers, including Gecko-based Mozilla Firefox, WebKit-based Apple Safari, and Chromium-based Google Chrome, and the new Microsoft Edge.

Free and open source, can be done in multiple languages, you can do functional, api, and accessibility testing.

Offer features such as taking screenshots, recording videos, emulating mobile devices, running tests in parallel, and intercepting network requests.

Auto-wait. It waits for elements to be actionable prior to performing actions.
Types of Testing using Playwright

UI Testing
Act as the end user clicking buttons, filling out form - to test out the functionality of web application.
API Testing
Validate data input and output; Mocking responses, stubbing responses
Visual Testing
Compare expected (screenshot) visual appearance of web page to the actual appearance after changes have been made
Accessibility Testing
Ensure web applications are usable and accessible to people with disabilities and adheres WCAG standards
Component Testing
Verify the expected behavior of React components

Here are some examples of what our team will be using Playwright to test:

There will be a main folder that will hold all of our tests from unit testing to E2E testing.

1. Pnpm playwright test
   Pnpm is our package manager we are currently using for our project, which stands for “performant npm”, b/c it runs faster than other package manager.
   Can run tests in headless mode (normal pnpm playwright test)
   Which means it can perform actions in the browser without having to show the browser UI
   Tell you if it passed or didn’t and a HTML report will pop up
   Pnpm exec playwright show-report and can click on each details
   This report show the test outcomes, test cases, which browser it was executed on and how long it took to execute
   Pnpm playwright test –ui (trace viewer)
   In playwright words “time travel experience with watch mode”. This allows you to filter by tests or by browser, run tests individually, see what happens, how long it took, watch and debug each test; see a full trace of your tests and how long it took
   Attachments will examine the image diff (the actual vs the expected image) which is done by using toHaveScreentShot() method and it will save the snapshots in a separate folder
   Debug (inspector) -
   Pnpm playwright test –debug
   Playwright inspector populates and show you where the code has paused at and allows you to walk through each individual steps to narrow down a root cause for preventing yourcode to perform
   Playwright inspector is a GUI (graphical user interface) tool that comes with the framework by default
   VS code extension: (codegen) this can be done via the Playwright inspector tool
   Chemical potion bottle should appear on the left of your Visual Studio Code
   Can chose to run tests in browsers
   It also help you debug
   It can help “record” tests for you
   Demo with Habit-sation

Playwright can also be used to test input data and forms.

Overall,
Playwright is fast and efficient
