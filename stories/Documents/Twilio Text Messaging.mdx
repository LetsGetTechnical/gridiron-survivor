# Text Messaging: Twilio

# By Adam Morsa

## Problem:

We need a way to deliver game results, reminders, weekly eliminations, and/or messages from
the commissioner to players via SMS.

## Solution Requirements:

- Must be able to send custom messages from the app to phone numbers as SMS or
  MMS
- Global number support would be nice

## Assumptions:

- N/A

## Solution:

Twilio is by far the most robust solution for app-to-SMS/MMS on the market. It is simple to set
up and easy to use. No other options compare.

```
//Download the helper library from https://www.twilio.com/docs/node/install
//Find your Account SID and Auth at twilio.com/console
//and set the environment variables.  See http://twil.io/secure
const accountSid = process.env.TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID;
const authToken = process.env.TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN;
const client = require('twilio)(accountSid, authToken);

client.messages
  .create({
    from: '+15557771212',
    body: 'Ahoy! This message was sent from my Twilio phone number!',
    to: '+15559991111'
  })
  .then(message => console.log(message.body));
```

## Security Considerations:

- As the industry leader in app-to-SMS services, Twilio boasts respectable security practices. [Read more here](https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/security).

## Cost Analysis:

- Each SMS sent costs a total of between $0.0109 and $0.0129/msg:
  $0.0079/msg+ Carrier Fee (between $0.0030 and $0.0050/msg depending on recipient
  carrier)
- Sender phone numbers cost $1.15/mo for a Twilio-leased phone number, or $0.50/mo to
  bring our own number

## Cross-Region Considerations:

- In many parts of the world outside the US, WhatsApp is the defacto platform for text
  messaging. Twilio supports WhatsApp as well, should we ever aim to expand beyond the
  US.

## Operational Readiness:

- Setup is simple and quick.

## Risks:

- Weâ€™ll need to be sure our code is not sending an extraneous or excessive number of
  texts to protect the source number from reports of spam or from incurring
  larger-than-necessary costs
- We may want to consider an opt-in for texts sent from the app on a per-user basis

## Solutions Considered and Discarded:

- No other options were considered- everybody and their mother says Twilio is the best.

## Work Required:

- (S) Lease a number from Twilio or set up our own and import it
- (XL) Set up our API calls for all instances where SMS messages are required/desired to
  be sent. Pick deadline reminders, weekly game results, elimination notifications, and
  custom commissioner messages.
