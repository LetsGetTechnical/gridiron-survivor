# Hosting: Vercel

## Problem:

We need a place to host our application.

## Solution Requirements:

- Must support Next.js application
- Must support logging and alerts

## Assumptions:

- Our app will be built using Next.js

## Solution:

We’ve decided on going with Vercel for hosting for now. With Vercel being the creators of
Next.js, it is the ideal platform to get our app up and running quickly for the MVP. While its
analytics and logging features are not as robust as Azure, they should suit us well enough in the
early stages. Read more about [analytics](https://vercel.com/docs/analytics) and [logging](https://vercel.com/docs/observability/runtime-logs).

Regarding alerts, we can configure notifications through the Vercel dashboard, which enables
us to view and manage alerts about deployments, domains, integrations, accounts, and usage.
Alerts can be viewed on the dashboard, and sent via email or SMS if needed. [Read more here](https://vercel.com/docs/dashboard-features/notifications).
As the app and our needs grow, we may migrate to Azure for its advanced features, such as
Application Insights and advanced monitoring.

## Security Considerations:

- Vercel boasts strong security best practices across the board. [Read more here](https://vercel.com/docs/security/overview).

## Cost Analysis:

- The Free plan is more than enough to support our application in its early stages.
- If, in the future, we run up against limits in the Free plan, the Pro plan is $20/mo- or, we
  just switch to Azure using Shashi’s Azure fund.

## Operational Readiness:

- Vercel is the native platform for Next.js apps. Minimal configuration is required.

## Risks:

- None that I can conceive

## Solutions Considered and Discarded:

- Azure DevOps. While features such as advanced monitoring and Application Insights are
  very tempting, it’s overkill for this stage of the product. As the product takes shape, we
  may yet transfer the application to Azure.

## Work Required:

- (S) Connect repo to Vercel
