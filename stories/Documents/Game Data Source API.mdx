# Game Data Source: API‐Sports’ American Football API

# By Adam Morsa Github: @ramblingadam

## Problem:

We need a reliable source for grabbing data about scheduled games, and daily game results.

## Solution Requirements:

- Must be inexpensive or free
- Data source must be updated daily with game results

## Assumptions:

- We will not need to query the data often. A cursory estimation of total queries follows:

* Daily queries to get game results: At most, several per day
* Weekly queries to get the next week’s schedule
* Seasonal query to get the initial game/team lineups

## Solution:

We will use API-Sports’ American Football API as our data source- specifically, the Games
endpoint will be our bread and butter for our application. This endpoint can return all games on
a given date, the teams in each game, and the scores, and is even live-updated every 15
minutes.

We should query the game information by date at most a few times per day from our backend,
then store those results in our DB. We can then serve this data to our users. This approach
will keep our API calls down and provide a single source of truth for all the app’s users to refer
to as opposed to API calls being made from the user’s end for updates.

## Security Considerations:

- N/A

## Cost Analysis:

- Freemium plan: 100 hits/day free, $0.0001/hit thereafter
- $15/mo: 7500 hits/day, hard limit

## Operational Readiness:

- API documentation is clear. Integration would not be difficult.

## Risks:

- There is always the chance of inaccurate data due to bugs or errors on the data source’s
  end. However, the developers seem to respond to issues quickly.

## Solutions Considered and Discarded:

- SportsDataIO - Prohibitively expensive ($5k/month)
- [Tank01 Live NFL API](https://rapidapi.com/tank01/api/tank01-nfl-live-in-game-real-time-statistics-nfl/) - A valid option. Consider it as a backup.

## Work Required:

- (S) Create an API-sports account. May require a credit card to account for potential overage
  charges
- (L) Build our API queries and code a system to convert the API data into tables to insert
  into our SQL database
