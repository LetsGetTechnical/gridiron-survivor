# Email: Twilio SendGrid Author: Adam Morsa

## Problem:

We need a way to deliver game results, reminders, weekly eliminations, and/or messages from
the commissioner to players via email.

## Solution Requirements:

- Need to be able to set up custom, automated emails

## Assumptions:

- N/A

## Solution:

Twilio SendGrid is the choice apparent for this functionality. Since we’re already using Twilio to
handle our SMS needs, it makes sense to utilize Twilio’s robust e-mail services as well. Like
their SMS API, the email API is simple and quick to set up. SendGrid has many nice features,
including engagement data monitoring and analytics, email validation to keep invalid emails of
our lists, and Deliverability Insights.

## Security Considerations:

- As an industry leader in app-to-email services, Twilio boasts respectable security
  practices. <a href = "https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/security">Read more here</a>.

## Cost Analysis:

- Free plan allows 100 emails/month
- $19.95/month for up to 50k emails/month

## Operational Readiness:

- Quick and simple to set up. Practically ready to go out of the box.

## Risks:

- Similar to the SMS risks, we need to ensure our app is not sending out excessive
  messages to protect ourselves from being tagged as a source of spam. Easy
  unsubscribe and opt-in to email alerts will help on this front.

## Solutions Considered and Discarded:

- Nodemailer, while fairly easy to set up, is not as robust a solution as Twilio SendGridmore for personal hobby projects than SaaS applications.

## Work Required:

- (S) Set up Twilio SendGrid API
- (XL) Set up our API calls for all instances where email messages are required/desired to
  be sent. Pick deadline reminders, weekly game results, elimination notifications, and
  custom commissioner messages.
