# Performance Metrics and KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)

# By Jennifer Tieu Github: @jennifertieu

For the performance metrics and KPIs, weâ€™ll be focusing on providing a good user experience
that is responsive/fast response time, accessible, mobile friendly, cross-browser support, and
minimal errors. (\*More metrics and KPIs to be added as needed)

## TODO: KPIs - specific numbers, initial load time, example: application to load within 3 sec, northstar to load within 1.5 sec

- Specific browsers, version?
- Lighthouse score specific - 90 MVP, 95 Northstar
- Accessibility: 5 error MVP, 0 errors Northstar
- Error-free/reliable - 90% to 99%
- How fast to respond, how fast is response
- Usage metrics - # of users

## Lighthouse - an open-source, automated tool for improving the quality of web pages. You can

run it against any web page, public or requiring authentication. It has audits for performance,
accessibility, progressive web apps, SEO, and more
