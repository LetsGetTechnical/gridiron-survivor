Performance Metrics and KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)
Author: Jennifer Tieu
For the performance metrics and KPIs, we’ll be focusing on providing a good user experience
that is responsive/fast response time, accessible, mobile friendly, cross-browser support, and
minimal errors. (\*More metrics and KPIs to be added as needed)
TODO: KPIs - specific numbers, initial load time, example: application to load with 3 sec,
northstar to load within 1.5 sec
● Specific browsers, version?
● Lighthouse score specific - 90 MVP, 95 Northstar
● Accessibility: 5 error MVP, 0 errors Northstar
● Error free/reliable - 90% to 99%
● How fast to response, how fast is response
● Usage metrics - # of users
